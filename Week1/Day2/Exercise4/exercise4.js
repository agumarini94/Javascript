console.log(a + b) //second expression
// Prediction: 55 because i didnt assigned 2 to the variable a. Just writte a sentence
// Actual: 23.
// the number of the variable a was changed.

//what is the value of c ? 
//prediction = empty or undefined 
console.log(c);
//Analyse the code below, what will be the outcome?
